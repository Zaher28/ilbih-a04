    Create a program that takes a product name as input and
    retrieves the current price and quantity for that product.
    The product data is in a data file in the JSON format  and
    looks like this (you will create this file as `exercise44_input.json`):

    {
        "products" : [
            {"name": "Widget", "price": 25.00, "quantity": 5 },
            {"name": "Thing", "price": 15.00, "quantity": 5 },
            {"name": "Doodad", "price": 5.00, "quantity": 10 }
        ]
    }

    Print out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found.
    If no product matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.
